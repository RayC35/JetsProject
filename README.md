## Difficulties and Lessons Learned
This project is uncompleted at this time. My code is throwing an Array Index Out Of Bounds exception, and I've been unable to resolve the issue. Aside from that, I've learned that I should run my application as I create it. Write a little, run it, write a little, run it again. While many things remain unclear to me, I feel that slowly the concepts and practices we go over in class are revealing themselves to me. Arrays and ArrayLists are still diffcult subjects for me as is visibility and return types. But I'm feeling better about constructors, getters and setters, and really just how to read code and discern the various parts of it. Review of past lessons and drills will continue to be crucial.
